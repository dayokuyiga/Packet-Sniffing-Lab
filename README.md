# Packet Sniffing Lab

## Objective

The Packet Sniffing Lab project aimed to understand and analyze network traffic using Wireshark by capturing and filtering different types of network packets.

### Skills Learned

- Capturing and analyzing live network traffic
- Using hex searches to locate specific data within the packets.
- Following TCP streams to track data exchanges.
- Network protocol knowledge and security vulnerability understanding.

### Tools Used

- Network analysis tools (Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.

## Steps
